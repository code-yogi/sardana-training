# Sardana training materials oriented to newcomers

This course aims to demostrate all the basic Sardana SCADA Suite features. The Sardana Suite includes two software projects: [Sardana](http://www.sardana-controls.org) and [Taurus](http://www.taurus-scada.org). After following this course you should be able to install, configure and use the Sardana system. Furthermore you should acquire the basic knowledge on how to extend the system in the following areas:
* integrate a new hardware into the system
* write an experiment procedure
* create a custom Graphical User Interface
* access an arbitrary data source from Taurus
