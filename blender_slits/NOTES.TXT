IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO EXECUTE:
$ blenderplayer slits_keyboard_only.blend

you can use arrows (up/down/left/right) to open horizontal and vertical gaps
with the <SHIFT> modifier you will inverse the movement of each blade:
UP arrow will move TOP blade UP, and <SHIFT>+<UP> will move TOP blade UP
DOWN arrow will move BOTTOM blade DOWN, and <SHIFT>+<DOWN> will move BOTTOM blade UP
and the same for left and right.
you can exit with Q or <Ctrl>+C


IN ORDER TO RUN A TCP SOCKET SERVER, YOU CAN PLAY WITH THE SYSTEM IN TWO TERMINALS:
TERM1: $ blenderplayer slits.blend
TERM2: $ python play_slits.py
