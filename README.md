# Sardana training materials

Two different modalities of the sardana training are foreseen. The first one
is oriented to the sardana users or people at the beginning of their
adventure with the project. These materials can be found in the `users`
directory. The second one is foreseen for the sardana developers or
advanced users. These materials can be found in the `developers` directory.
Please refer to each of the directorie's README for more details on how to
follow the training.
